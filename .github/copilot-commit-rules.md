# Copilot Commit Message Rules

- All commit messages must be written in **English**.
- Use the **Conventional Commits** format with an appropriate **emoji** prefix for each commit type.
- Example commit message structure:

  <emoji> <type>(scope?): description

- Common types and emojis:
  - ✨ feat: for new features
  - 🐛 fix: for bug fixes
  - ♻️ refactor: for code refactoring
  - 📝 docs: for documentation changes
  - 🎨 style: for formatting, missing semi colons, etc.
  - 🚀 perf: for performance improvements
  - ✅ test: for adding or updating tests
  - 🔧 chore: for build process or auxiliary tool changes
  - ⬆️ build: for dependency updates
  - ⏪ revert: for reverting changes

- The description should be concise and in the imperative mood (e.g., "add user login validation").
- Scope is optional and should be in parentheses if used (e.g., feat(auth): add JWT support).
- Do not use Portuguese or other languages in commit messages.
- Do not use generic messages like "update" or "fix bug"; always specify what and why.
